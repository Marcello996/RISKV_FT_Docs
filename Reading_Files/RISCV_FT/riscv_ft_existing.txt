	NMR (N-modular redundancy) at combinational elements;
---BENCHMARK ALGORITHMS
	

-"A Low-Cost Fault-Tolerant RISC-V Processor for Space Systems"
---TECHNICS
	Hamming code to protect the memory elements (PC in the fetch unit and registers in register file);
	TMR (Triple modular redundancy) to protect the ALU and the control unit;
---BENCHMARK ALGORITHMS
	vector addition;
	CCSDS-123;
	Coremark benchmark;
---LIMITS
	not consider clock-tree and RAM issues so they considered only the effects in the processor while the effects in the FPGA configuration memory were not treated.


-"Towards a Heterogeneous Fault-Tolerance Architecture based on Arm and RISC-V Processors"
---TECHNICS
	DCLS --> dual core lockstep (ARM Cortex A9 + RISCV(on FPGA) + Lockstep accelerator (xLockstep on FPGA)) 
			 xLockstep --> Synchro + Checker
---BENCHMARK ALGORITHMS


-"Reliable low-power digital signal processing via reduced precision redundancy"
---TECHNICS
	ANT technique: reduced precision redundancy (RPR). RPR employs a reduced precision replica of a DSP system [referred to as main DSP (MDSP)] to detect and correct the errors occurring at the output of the MDSP system.

-"Towards a fault tolerant RISC-V softcore"
---TECHNICS
	Hsiao SEC/DED code for cache memory;
---BENCHMARK ALGORITHMS
	saboteurs;

-Applying Compiler-Automated Software Fault Tolerance to Multiple Processor Platforms
	---TECHNICS
	It provides automated compiler modification of software programs to insert dual- or triple-modular redundancy.
	It adds fault mitigation to user software through duplication or triplication of instructions and data.

-"A RISC-V Fault-Tolerant Microcontroller Core Architecture Based on a Hardware Thread Full-Weak protection and a Thread-Controlled Watch-Dog Timer"
---TECHNICS
	HART0 fully protected with TMR-based (PC, Control & Status registers, Processing Pipeline, Register File).
	HART1 and HART2 are weakly protected: register file is not protected as in HART0, but a weak protection is guaranteed by TC-WDT.
---BENCHMARK ALGORITHMS
	TCL scripts which force random bit flip in each flip-flop inside the core;


-"An ALU Protection Methodology for SoftProcessors on SRAM-Based FPGAs"
---TECHNICS
